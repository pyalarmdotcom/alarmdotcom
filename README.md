## Intro

This is a custom component to allow Home Assistant to interface with the [Alarm.com](https://www.alarm.com/) site by scraping the Alarm.com web portal. This component is designed primarily integrate the Alarm.com security system functions, so it requires an Alarm.com package which includes security system support. We're just starting to add support for smart devices like lights, garage doors, etc.

Please note that Alarm.com may break functionality at any time.

## Safety Warnings

This integration is great for casual use within Home Assistant but... **do not rely on this integration to keep you safe.**

1. This integration communicates with Alarm.com over an unofficial channel that can be broken or shut down at any time.
2. It may take several minutes for this device to receive a status update from Alarm.com's servers.
3. Your automations may be buggy.
4. This code may be buggy. It's written by volunteers in their free time and testing is spotty.

You should use Alarm.com's official apps, devices, and services for notifications of all kinds related to safety, break-ins, property damage (e.g.: freeze sensors), etc.

Where possible, use local control for smart home devices that are natively supported by Home Assistant (lights, garage door openers, etc.). Locally controlled devices will continue to work during internet outages whereas this integraiton will not.

| Smoke                   | Both integrated units (e.g.: [First Alert ZCOMBO](https://www.firstalert.com/smoke-carbon-monoxide-alarms/combo-smoke-carbon-monoxide-alarms/wireless-smoke-carbon-monoxide-alarm-works-with-zwave-ring/SAP_ZCOMBO.html)) and listeners (e.g. [Encore FireFighter [PDF]](https://2gig.com/wp-content/uploads/Encore-Firefighter-specs-345.pdf))                                                |

| Glass Break / Vibration | Both standalone listeners (e.g.: [DSC PGx922](https://www.dsc.com/?n=products&o=view&id=2585)) & control-panel built-ins (e.g. [Qolsys IQ Panel 4](https://qolsys.com/panel-glass-break/)).                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Motion                  | Use with caution. This integration polls Alarm.com for updates once per minute; it may miss motion events that take place between updates. Conversely, [some users have reported](https://github.com/uvjustin/alarmdotcom/issues/106#issuecomment-1090604701) that Alarm.com motion sensors stay active for many minutes, meaning that it may be difficult to determine when motion has ended. |
| Freeze                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Note that Alarm.com can has multiple designations for each sensor and not all are known to the developers of this integration. If you have one of the above listed devices but don't see it in Home Assistant, [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/uvjustin/alarmdotcom/issues/new/choose).

#### Subsensors

Each sensor in your system is created as both a device and as an entity within Home Assistant. Each sensor and lock has an associated low battery sensor that activates when the device's battery is low. Each sensor, lock, and control panel has an associated malfunction sensor that activates when either Alarm.com reports an issue or when this integration is unable to process data for a sensor.

### Future Support

#### Roadmapped Devices

The developers have access to the devices listed below and plan to add support in a future release.

| Device Type  | Notes                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Image Sensor | _Not_ video cameras. Image sensors (e.g.: [Qolsys Image Sensor](https://qolsys.com/image-sensor/)) take still photos when triggered by motion events. |

#### Help Wanted Devices

If you own one of the below devices and want to help build support, [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/uvjustin/alarmdotcom/issues/new/choose).

| Device Type        | Notes                                                                                                                    | Help Needed |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| RGB Light          | e.g.: [Inovelli RGBW Smart Bulb](https://inovelli.com/rgbw-smart-bulb-z-wave/)                                           | A lot.      |
| Video Camera       | e.g.: [Alarm.com ADC-V515](https://www.alarmgrid.com/products/alarm-com-adc-v515)                                        | A lot.      |
| Water Valve        | e.g.: [Dome Water Main Shut-off](https://www.domeha.com/z-wave-water-main-shut-off-valve)                                | A lot.      |
| Thermostat         | e.g.: [Alarm.com Intelligent Thermostat](https://suretyhome.com/product/intelligent-thermostat/)                         | A lot.      |
| Leak Sensor        | e.g.: [Dome Leak Sensor](https://www.domeha.com/z-wave-leak-sensor)                                                      | A little.   |
| Temperature Sensor | e.g.: [Alarm.com PowerG Wireless Temperature Sensor](https://suretyhome.com/product/powerg-wireless-temperature-sensor/) | A little.   |

##### Help Needed Scale

- **A lot:** You'll need to know how to capture web traffic. We'll ask you to log into Alarm.com and use your web browser's network inspector tool to capture requests for all of your device's functions.
- **A little:** We'll ask you to run a Python script to dump metadata for your devices. This is straightforward and doesn't require much technical skill.

#### Device Blacklist

These devices are known but blocked from appearing in Home Assistant. If you disagree with any of these blacklisting reasons, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/uvjustin/alarmdotcom/issues/new/choose)!

| Device Type        | Reason                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mobile Phones      | Some control panels support PIN-less proximity unlocking via bluetooth (e.g.: [Qolsys IQ Panel 4](https://qolsys.com/bluetooth/)). Paired mobile phones appear in Alarm.com as sensors, but don't provide any useful functions or information for use in Home Assistant (not even malfunction or battery level). |
| Audio Systems      | Alarm.com supports Sonos systems, but Home Assistant has a better, built-in integration for these devices.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Irrigation Systems | Like above, Home Assistant probably has better direct integrations for these devices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Blinds and Shades  | _(See above.)_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
