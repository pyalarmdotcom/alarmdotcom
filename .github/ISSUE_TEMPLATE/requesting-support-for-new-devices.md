The alarmdotcom maintainers don't have direct access to all Alarm.com devices. We need your help to support new devices.

Please open one issue per device.

**Which device would you like us to support?**
Provide the device name and a link to a page with device details.
(E.g.: Intelligent Thermostat: https://suretyhome.com/product/intelligent-thermostat/)

**Where does this device appear in the Alarm.com mobile app?**
Security System, Images, Locks, Garage Doors, etc.

**What types of actions does this device support?**
E.g.: Garage doors support opening and closing. Alarm systems support arming (home, away, and night modes) and disarming.

**Which provider do you use?**
E.g.: Alarm Net, ADT, Surety Home, etc.

**Include pyalarmdotcomajax Server Output**
This is an important step. It's helpful for us to see how this device is represented on the Alarm.com server. We have a tool for dumping this data via the command line.

1. Install the `adc` command line tool using the instructions at https://github.com/pyalarmdotcom/alarmdotcom/wiki/How-to-Test-&-Debug#install-the-adc-command-line-tool.
2. Run the `Unsupported Devices` command template in the table on the adc instructions page.
3. Copy & paste here the relevant data from the output of the Unsupported Devices command.

**Heads Up!** The above command dumps server data for all devices that are known to ADC developers, including a few devices that are currently unsupported. This command may leak sensitive information. It does _not_ dump your email address, address, or any other account information, but it may output coordinates from GPS devices (like an Alarm.com car sensor) and names of family members (e.g.: Michael's Room Window Sensor). Be sure to review the data before posting to scrub anything that you're not comfortable posting online.

**Include Action Endpoints**
This is a more technical than the last step, but in order to support actions for devices we need you to use your browser's developer tools to tell us which endpoints the Alarm.com app uses to control these devices. For example, for a garage door, we would need the following information:

> Base URL: `https://www.alarm.com/web/api/devices/garageDoors/`
> Open Suffix: `open`
> Close Suffix: `close`

(Opening a garage door requires submitting a request to `https://www.alarm.com/web/api/devices/garageDoors/open`.)

Basic instructions for capturing action data in Chrome are available at https://github.com/pyalarmdotcom/alarmdotcom/wiki/How-to-Test-&-Debug#capturing-post-data-in-chrome. Be sure to post both request body data and request URL data.
